# logic for the MQ sensors calibration based on parameters coming from 
# SCD sensor. 
# Hence temperature and RH will be used for obtaining resistance ratio 
# then a formula with points interpolation is applied for calculating current 
# ppm concetration starting from new already points known on curve 
# Those points should be configurable.
# obtained values are not completely precise, but in relative context will work well too.
